```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## What data do I want?
# - I would like perGame and advStats for each player in 2015
# - the salary of that player for 2015

```{r}
perGame <- read.csv("../data/player-data-wrangled/player2015/PerGame-2015wrangled.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

advStats <- read.csv("../data/player-data-wrangled/player2015/Adv-2015wrangled.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
Merge the data frames
```{r}
pgAdv <- merge(perGame, advStats, by = c("Player","Pos","G","Tm","Age","fix"))
pgAdv <- pgAdv[-c(7,8,33,34,48,53)]
colnames(pgAdv)
```
```{r}
summary(pgAdv)
```

# Get Player data
```{r}
fAgents <- read.csv('../data/salary-data/fixed-fa-signings/fixed-2015.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
fAgents <- fAgents[-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)]
colnames(fAgents)
```
# Merge into final data frame
```{r}
mega <- merge(pgAdv, fAgents, by.x = "fix", by.y ="name")
mega <- mega[-c(1,2,3,5)]
colnames(mega)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(corrplot)
M <- cor(mega)
corrplot(M,method = "square")
```
