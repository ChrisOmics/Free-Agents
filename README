== Predicting NBA Salaries using Multiple Linear Regression ==
==============================================================
By Konner Macias, Nikhil Sharma, Ben Messinger, & Ronaq Virdi


A stepping stone on our quest of uncovering what NBA players 
deserve in terms of salary. We went down many different paths
in hopes for gaining a better hollistic understanding, and 
to improve our accuracy in predictions. We achieved our personal
goal of creating a statistically valid model, as we were
mentored by UCLA Statistics Professor, Akram Almohalwas. We
will continue to improve upon our model as time goes on. As for
now, we have creating a perfectly sound multiple linear
regression model that predicts NBA salaries.

We created a model targeted for those entering free agency for 
the 2018-2019 season, and we also created a model that predicts
salaries in hindsight over the past 4 previous seasons.


Most of our data was gathered by those who already attempted
this project, but had made fatal errors in their variable and
model selection. Credit goes to:

Please note that we only took their data, and did not run or 
copy any of their code.

	Folder that contains NBA player's perGame and advanced
	statistics along with free agent lists, and salaries for
	years 2011-2017.

== Final Comments ==
====================
Our data is free for anyone to use, if you find it fitting for 
your own project. Our code however, should not be replicated.
